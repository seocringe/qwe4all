# This script is used to activate a virtual environment in the qwe4all project.
# It should be sourced from the bash shell using the command "source bin/activate".
# Running the script directly will not work.

# The script sets up the necessary environment variables and paths for the virtual environment.
# It also unsets any irrelevant variables and sets the prompt to indicate the active virtual environment.

# The `deactivate` function is defined to reset the environment variables and unset the virtual environment.
# It also removes the `deactivate` function itself, unless the argument "nondestructive" is provided.

# The script also includes commands to refresh the shell's command hash table, ensuring that the updated
# PATH changes are respected.

# Usage: source bin/activate
# This file must be used with "source bin/activate" *from bash*
# you cannot run it directly
